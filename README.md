### About myself
I have been in testing for more than 4 last years, working on software quality of web desktop/mobile, API, and mobile applications.
In November 2023 I finished a course - Automation Software Testing (with honor) by GlobalLogic vs Prometheus and after that, I continued learning automation Selenium (Python) by myself.
I am looking for a great opportunity for my skills and desire to make the software user experience better.
